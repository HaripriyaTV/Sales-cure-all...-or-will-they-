## Univariate Analysis 

### Initial Insights from the Analysis

#### Target Variable

Since the target variable is continuous, it is visualized by plotting its histogram.

Item_Outlet_Sales is a right skewd variable and would need some data transformation to treat its skewness.

#### Independent Numeric Variables

The independent numeric variables from the dataset are plotted using their histograms to visualize their distributions.

#### Observations

- There seemed to be no clear-cut pattern in Item_Weight.
- Item_Visibility is right-skewed and should be transformed to curb its skewness. The zero observation is the highest in the plot and the observation has to be treated.
- There are 4 different distributions for Item_MRP.

#### Independent Categorical Variables

The following are the visualization and insights from the independent categorical variables.

#### Observations
- In Outlet_Sizeâ€™s plot, for 4016 observations, Outlet_Size is blank or missing.
- Lesser number of observations in the data for the outlets established in the year 1998 as compared to the other years.
- Supermarket Type 1 seems to be the most popular category of Outlet_Type.
